# snake_game_by_AI

### The project aims to create a snake game that can be played by an artificial intelligence (AI). The AI will be trained to play the game using reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning that allows an agent to learn how to behave in an environment by trial and error. The AI will be given a reward for eating food and a penalty for hitting a wall or its own body. Over time, the AI will learn to play the game more and more effectively.

### The project will be implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Pygame is a cross-platform library that allows you to create games in Python. The project will also use the Tensorflow library for deep learning. Tensorflow is a popular library for machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### The project will be divided into the following stages:

### 1. Game development: The first stage will involve developing the snake game itself. This will include creating the game's graphics, physics, and AI.

### 2. Reinforcement learning: The second stage will involve training the AI to play the game. This will involve creating a reinforcement learning environment and training the AI using a neural network.

### 3. Evaluation: The third stage will involve evaluating the AI's performance. This will involve running the AI against different opponents and measuring its win rate.

### The project is expected to take several months to complete. The project will be challenging, but it will be a great opportunity to learn about reinforcement learning, deep learning, and game development.

### Here are some of the benefits of this project:

### 1. It will teach you about reinforcement learning, a powerful machine learning technique that can be used to solve a variety of problems.

### 2. It will teach you about deep learning, a type of machine learning that is used to train neural networks.

### 3. It will teach you about game development, a fun and rewarding hobby.

### 4. It will give you the opportunity to create your own game, which is a great way to showcase your skills.
